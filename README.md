## Project description

mcDelivery Sri Lanka app is a service based app which is offered by mcDonald's Sri Lanka for the customers in Sri Lanka to place orders via android platform. It was developed by Abans Restaurants. Eventhough mcDonald's is a renowed company around the world, the application developed for online ordering does not seem to be fulfilling the required user experience. So we selected that to make better UX.
